The application that our group built is a web based video game that falls into the 2D platformer genre. The website portion of the game has the ability to create an account and log in. Once you are logged in you have access to the game with a bunch of features to go along with it such as a live chat, leaderboards, and tutorial on the controls in the game. The game has a series of levels that the player has to try to win in any order they want. The levels consist of enemies, jumping puzzles, and power ups. Once you win the level it will submit your time to the leaderboard on the website which anyone can view.
