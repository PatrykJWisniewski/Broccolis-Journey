## [Link to Game](https://kylefaucher.github.io/game-website/)

The application that our group built is a web based video game that falls into the 2D platformer genre. The website portion of the game has the ability to create an account and log in. Once you are logged in you have access to the game with a bunch of features to go along with it such as a live chat, leaderboards, and tutorial on the controls in the game. The game has a series of levels that the player has to try to win in any order they want. The levels consist of enemies, jumping puzzles, and power ups. Once you win the level it will submit your time to the leaderboard on the website which anyone can view.

This repository has the files for both the game and the website that hosts it. The CSCI-3308-Project folder contains all of the Unity files for the game. The final-game-website folder contains the complete website with the webGL Unity build and all of the html, css, and js files files. 

## Running and Testing Code
To run and test the website, navigate to the final-game-website directory and start a local server, on Mac, we used the following command in terminal

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

To open and test the full Unity game (not the webGL build), open the CSCI-3308-Project folder in Unity version 2019.2.8f1. To make a webGL build of the Unity code, got to File > Build > Select webGL > Build
